        <p> We are living in a multi-cultural diverse world, with a huge variety of different countries, nations,
            communities.
            Our world is a great place to live in and we all need to strive for the better co-existence for all of us.
            While talking about culture of different nations - there are lots of things to consider in terms of
            similarities and opposites. </p>

        <p>
            According to Wikipedia, <b> the cultural diversity </b> is the quality of diverse or different cultures, opposite to
            monoculture. It might apply to cultural products like art works in museums or entertainment available
            online, or sometimes - to the variety of human cultures or traditions in a specific region, or in
            the world as a whole. It can also refer to the inclusion of different cultural perspectives in an
            organization or society.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the context of national and international efforts to promote or preserve cultural diversity, the term
            applies to <u> five overlapping domains:</u>
            <ol type="1" class="five-domains">
                <li> <i> Economic: </i> the availability of diverse cultural goods or services. </li>
                <li> <i> Artistic: </i> the variety of artistic genres and styles that coexist.</li>
                <li> <i>Participatory: </i> the participation of diverse ethnic groups in a nation's culture.</li>
                <li> <i>Heritage: </i> the diversity of cultural traditions that are represented in heritage
                    institutions such as museums.</li>
                <li> <i>Multicultural: </i> the variety of ethnic groups and their traditions that are visible in a
                    country.</li>
            </ol> 

        <p> Using all the benefits of cultural diversity and enjoying the positive aspects it provides - can be possible
            in a peaceful and friendly environment. Unfortunately, because of the full-scale russian invasion in Ukraine
            in
            2022, millions of Ukrainians were forced to leave their country and flee from the war, seeking the temporary
            protection in different countries. Culture, education for the vast majority of such Ukrainians, have
            receeded far back in the list of the life priorities. While preserving their own lives and health have
            become
            crucial for them.
        </p>

        <p> Ireland, hosting more than 100.000 Ukrainians, providing temporary protection, housing and social
            benefits, did a huge positive impact on the lives of each and every Ukrainian coming to Ireland during these
            tough times. All of the Ukrainians, including me, are grateful for all the support Ireland has provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ukraine is a very talented nation, having lots to offer to the world in terms of its cultural heritage. A
            great amount of singers, artists, musicians have been performing in Ukraine and all over the world before
            the war started, and nowadays as well. Despite that, there are not so many Ukrainian cultural events held in
            Ireland and in Cork since 2022. But the interest for such events amongst Ukrainians and Irish people is
            constantly increasing.
