        <p> We are living in a multi-cultural diverse world, with a huge variety of different countries, nations,
            communities.
            Our world is a great place to live in and we all need to strive for the better co-existence for all of us.
            While talking about culture of different nations - there are lots of things to consider in terms of
            similarities and opposites. </p>
    
        <p>
            According to Wikipedia, the cultural diversity is the quality of diverse or different cultures, opposite to
            monoculture. It might apply to cultural products like art works in museums or entertainment available
            online, or sometimes - to the variety of human cultures or traditions in a specific region, or in
            the world as a whole. It can also refer to the inclusion of different cultural perspectives in an
            organization or society.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the context of national and international efforts to promote or preserve cultural diversity, the term applies to five overlapping domains:
            <ol type="1" class="five-domains">
                <li> <i> Economic: </i> the availability of diverse cultural goods or services. </li>
                <li> <i> Artistic: </i> the variety of artistic genres and styles that coexist.</li>
                <li> <i>Participatory: </i>  the participation of diverse ethnic groups in a nation's culture.</li>
                <li> <i>Heritage: </i>  the diversity of cultural traditions that are represented in heritage institutions such as museums.</li> 
                <li> <i>Multicultural: </i>  the variety of ethnic groups and their traditions that are visible in a country.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
