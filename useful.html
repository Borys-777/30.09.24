        <p> We are living in a multi-cultural diverse world, with a huge variety of different countries, nations,
            communities.
            Our world is a great place to live in and we all need to strive for the better co-existence for all of us.
            While talking about culture of different nations - there are lots of things to consider in terms of
            similarities and opposites. </p>

        <p>
            In the context of national and international efforts to promote or preserve cultural diversity, the term
            applies to five overlapping domains:
            <ol type="1" class="five-domains">
                <li> <i> Economic: </i> the availability of diverse cultural goods or services. </li>
                <li> <i> Artistic: </i> the variety of artistic genres and styles that coexist.</li>
                <li> <i>Participatory: </i> the participation of diverse ethnic groups in a nation's culture.</li>
                <li> <i>Heritage: </i> the diversity of cultural traditions that are represented in heritage
                    institutions such as museums.</li>
                <li> <i>Multicultural: </i> the variety of ethnic groups and their traditions that are visible in a
                    country.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
